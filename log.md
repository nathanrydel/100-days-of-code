### Day 6: May 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read the documentation for ESLint VS Code Extension and attempted to add configuration into Freemote Project and Rydel Personal Portfolio-Betav2 branch. Went through various HTML projects in Week 1 for error correction. Attempting to close Sections 23-25 of ProgrammingExpert course.

**Thoughts**: Familiarizing with documentation is key to working with new modules or packages and a necessary step in the development process. Python and JavaScript have such different syntax that are somewhat difficult to keep straight when learning at the same time.

### Day 7: May 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Building second version of RydelPortfolio (Dark Version) in a private repo for testing. Attempting to use a template found online as the backbone and customizing for my needs. Also completed the Introductory Course from ProgrammingExpert. Completed all videos and practice problems. Completed the coding assesment challenges from ProgrammingExpert.

**Thoughts**: Trying to work from a code base with minimal documenation is quite challenging. I need to cherry pick the files as there is too much going on with the template that it may take some work to fully configure. I will need to come up with a more robust solution to get nathanrydel.dev up and running.

For the coding assessments from ProgrammingExpert, I will try to watch the solutions without coding to really familarize myself with the concepts and then attempt the challenges myself to see if the concepts stick. May need some refreshers before continuing onto the OOP portion.

### Day 8: May 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on portfolio so that I can have the updated look go live. Attempted to have the Skills Section and Tools Section have the appropriate logo downloaded and set from internal source. Found alternative CDN hosted to serve the images. Able to link the correct logo image to their corresponding element.

**Thoughts**: Should really learn how to link Vanilla JS to internal sources. Even using JS, there are some tips for looping elements and serving them to the DOM that I should focus more attention onto. I should also learn more regex in JS instead of relying on pre-made solutions as this may be very helpful in leetCode and Coding test/practice problems in the future.

### Day 9: May 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to host screenshots of portfolio elements on a site to use as a CDN. Completed work on portfolio and published to home domain. Cleaned up single portfolio item screenshots and added to site. Deployed site.

**Thoughts**: Finished products are never truly finished. After pushing and merging the updates to the main branch for deploy I envitably found bugs and errors in my site almost immediately. Spent some time figuring our the issues and PR process in Github.

### Day 10: May 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Looking at the documentation for Bootstrap and React to learn more about how to implement them into my own projects moving forward. Will look to other tutorials and learn how to implement Firebase into more projects. Had interview for Tech Support Engineer where React, NodeJS, and Firebase would be used together more.

**Thoughts**: There are a lot of options available to make fully functional apps. Need to get more backend practice and DB practice to make more complex sites beyond Single Page CRA apps. Will need to refactor existing site to be React as next project.

### Day 11: May 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Shopify from 30,000 ft lessons and setup a demo store using the Dawn theme. Continued with lessons for to cover backend configuration for Shopify stores. Reserching MERN stack for project ideas and to learn in demand skills. Will consider learning TS and Web3 as well to diversify skill set.

**Thoughts**: Want to get experience with fullstack architecture and principles. Should still continue to focus and get familiar with front-end and CSS stylings. Also looked into installing Ubuntu on a flash drive to use for developing as Linux seems to be the preferred platform after macOS.
