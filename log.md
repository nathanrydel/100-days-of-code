### Day 6: May 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read the documentation for ESLint VS Code Extension and attempted to add configuration into Freemote Project and Rydel Personal Portfolio-Betav2 branch. Went through various HTML projects in Week 1 for error correction. Attempting to close Sections 23-25 of ProgrammingExpert course.

**Thoughts**: Familiarizing with documentation is key to working with new modules or packages and a necessary step in the development process. Python and JavaScript have such different syntax that are somewhat difficult to keep straight when learning at the same time.
